This repository is a proof of concept (PoC) exploring project structure and service composition in Go.
The focus is not on implementing production-ready logic, but on experimenting with how to organize and structure a multi-service monorepo, with a centralized identity layer as the core building block.


### Goals

Demonstrate Golang project structuring using multiple layers of identity.

Explore patterns for building multiple services inside a single monorepo.

Experiment with using a shared identity/authentication layer across services.

Provide a reference for project layout rather than business logic or feature implementation.


### Non-Goals

This is not meant to be a finished product.

Business logic, full error handling, or production security practices are out of scope.

The repo is exploratory â€” expect incomplete code, stubs, and placeholders.
